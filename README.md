Scripts for the technical blog "Efficient Array Signal Processing with Compressed Sensing".
 ## Summary of the Technical Blog
This technical artical delves into the concept of compressed sensing and its applications in array signal processing, demonstrating its effectiveness through MATLAB implementations.
Compressed sensing offers significant advantages over traditional Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation techniques such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT) algorithms particularly in its ability to accurately recover signals from a limited number of measurements. This approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also improves performance in scenarios with sparse data, making it a powerful tool in modern signal processing.
